<!--
Compensation requests have a specific format that enables them to be parsed programmatically for more efficient budgeting. Please make sure you stick to the template. A linter will evaluate your request after you remove [WIP] from the issue title and notify you of any issues.

See the following link for details:
https://bisq.wiki/Making_a_compensation_request

Feel free to browse other requests if you're not sure about something, or reach out in #compensation on Keybase (https://keybase.io/team/bisq).

## Summary

> _Specify the total amount of BSQ you are requesting, along with the USD total and BSQ/USD rate:_

- **BSQ requested**: **`[BSQ amount]`** <!-- [BSQ amount] should be: USD amount / BSQ rate -->
- USD requested: [USD amount] <!-- [USD amount] should be: total of all contributions listed in "contributions delivered" table below -->
- BSQ rate: [rate] USD per BSQ <!-- [rate] should be the rate used to determine the BSQ amount above, as specified in the cycle's rate announcement (https://bisq.wiki/Compensation_Maintainer#Announce_BSQ-USD_rate) -->
